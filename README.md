# Data Cleaning and Visualization on Titanic Dataset
This repository contains a Google Colab notebook that performs data cleaning and visualization on the Titanic dataset. The project aims to explore and visualize the key aspects of the Titanic dataset to gain insights into the factors that influenced the survival rates of passengers.

**Project Overview**

The Titanic dataset is a classic example in the field of data science, used to predict the survival of passengers based on various factors like age, gender, ticket class, etc. This project focuses on cleaning the data and creating meaningful visualizations to extract insights.

**Data Cleaning Process**

The data cleaning process involves the following steps: Handling Missing Values: We address missing values in columns like Age, Embarked, and Cabin. Feature Engineering: Creating new features like FamilySize and Title to improve the dataset's descriptive power. Data Transformation: Transforming categorical variables into numerical ones and normalizing the data. Outlier Detection and Removal: Identifying and handling outliers to ensure the accuracy of our visualizations.

**Visualization and Insights**

The notebook includes 10 meaningful visualizations with accompanying insights. Some of the key visualizations include:

 1.Survival Rate by Passenger Class: Demonstrates how passenger class impacted survival chances.
 2.Age Distribution of Survivors and Non-Survivors: Provides insight into how age influenced survival.
 3.Gender-Based Survival Rates: Highlights the significant gender disparity in survival rates.
 4.Fare Distribution by Class and Survival: Analyzes how fare price correlated with survival rates across different classes.
 5.Survival Rates by Embarkation Point: Examines the impact of the port of embarkation on survival. Each visualization is followed by a detailed insight explaining the findings and their significance.

To run the notebook, you need the following Python libraries:
 * pandas
 * numpy
 * matplotlib
 * seaborn
